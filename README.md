Hello John,

The system is still mostly complete. Apologies.

What is remains is:

Fixing the CORS errors between UI and API.
Populating data in db
Adding loop up getters

I did the best I could for a 24 hour rush job. Apologies for the Shoddy code.

Setup:

1) There is new folder called Database, in there you will find .mdf and .ldf files that you can add to your SQL instance.
2) Insert dummy data for Menu, Customer tables. Order is optional.
3) Web API and Website will need to be hosted on IIS.

Apologies again, not my best work.
 
Best regards

Thamie
